        <subtitle>1. Investigate ways to incorporate code and/or documentation reviews into the core curriculum</subtitle>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Ongoing:</strong>
        <ul class="ulstyle">
            <li>At some point, in the junior level SWE classes, we need to have a course in which students work ALONE to create a relatively small example of a software application that demonstrates their mastery of all skills taught in the programming sequence.  This assignment would be similar in nature to a 1322 assignment and could be placed in 3623 (to demonstrate translating requirements into working programs) or in 3643 (to use in the TQA process). While teamwork is valuable, in many cases, the stronger programming students carry the load for the team and students slip through without additional programming for the rest of the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Suggestion:</strong>
        <ul class="ulstyle">
            <li>In SWE 3643 students do already a simple code review as a project: we could make it "bigger" and we could add SRS review in SWE 3623.</li>
        </ul>

        <subtitle>2. Investigate ways to make team projects in early SWE course more meaningful, and reflective of what it is to work on a real-world project. </subtitle>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Done:</strong>
        <ul class="ulstyle">
            <li>In SWE 3313, we added a requirement for the teams to create a high fidelity prototype of the user interface and then implement the customer facing side of the interface in either Java GUI or C# GUI. In SWE4323, students work in pairs to create a customized interface suited to their partner's request.  Their work is created using a real world prototyping tool.  Marvel is what is suggested, but students may also use InVision or Adobe XD.</li>

        <subtitle>3. Ensuring that students have sufficient technical skill prior to reaching their senior year and being assigned to a capston project?</subtitle>

        <br>
        <strong>Ongoing:</strong>
        <ul class="ulstyle">
            <li>Creating and administering a basic SWE skills test as a pre-req to registering for any 4000 level classes.</li>

        <subtitle>4. Feasibility of adding an business/industry communication course to the SWE curriculum?</subtitle>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Ongoing:</strong>
        <ul class="ulstyle">
            <li>Create a seminar or special topics course on professional development.  This course would include resume writing, interviewing skills, mock interviews, guest speakers from industry, presentation skills, professional communication skills and practice, along with general etiquette. I find that many of our students are lacking skills in these areas.  </li>
            <li>Given we have several seminars across the department and college, various directed studies, research methods, and courses that require extensive oral/written skills (like 3801, 4713, 4724, TCOM 1100/2010), we can continue emphasize these skills related to communication within those courses.</li>
            <li>In Spring 21, we will offer a special topic course in which students will work on a project (from elicitation to at least a working prototype) and a lot of the focus will be on communication within the group, in the business environment and with the stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>
