			<subtitle>Aims and Scope</subtitle>
			<br>
			<p>Driven by the recent developments of digital transformations and high-fault-tolerant systems, High-Confidence Computing (HCC) was coined as a new computing paradigm that crosses and fusions the key properties of securing computing, precise computing, and intelligent computing to support the next-generation information systems such as smart-city, smart-society, and autonomous driving. HCC technologies rely on interdisciplinary methodologies to realize secure and trusted software/hardware, precise and process-traceable algorithms, and self-evolving designs that can adapt to new environments and support new applications. Information systems possessing HCC properties can provide collaborative services that are otherwise impossible as security, traceability, accountability, reliability, robustness, extensibility, adaptivity, and self-evolution are all desired and equally-important properties of modern complex systems.</p>
			<p>The Elsevier HCC Journal is dedicated to publishing rigorously peer-reviewed, high-quality original articles covering fundamental research outcomes that fusion the three domains of secure computing, precise computing, and intelligent computing, as well as complex system designs that jointly consider the properties of secure and trusted hardware/software, precise and process-traceable algorithms, and self-evolving systems that can adapt to new environments and support new applications. The journal intends to provide a unique interdisciplinary platform for researchers and practitioners who are interested in the basic research of high-confidence computing and the complex system developments considering high-confidence properties to demonstrate their novel and creative designs. Other than the original research papers on all aspects of high-confidence computing from theory and applications, the journal also publishes review articles with inspiring open research discussions that can motivate new ideas of realizing high-confidence computing.
